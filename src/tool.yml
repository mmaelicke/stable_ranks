    title: Stable ranks MetaCatalog data loader
    description: | 
      Loads an ISMN database dump to a Metacatalog instance. 
      **This tool is meant to be run by database admins only.** The loader requires a connection
      to the Metacatalog instance and needs the ISMN database dump to be at the machine that
      is running MetaCatalog API. The upload tool does not (yet) send a copy of the data to the
      API, but rather creates a Datasource pointing to the files themselves. The Datasource.args
      are set to make MetaCatalog work with the *.stm files directly.
